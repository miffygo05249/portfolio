      <h2>Dynamic Wetlands</h2>
        <p>The topic of my research is finding if wetland plants grow better when</p>
        <p>they are dry, wet, or soaked.  If the amount of water is wet, then, the plant</p> 
        <p>will grow the highest.I predict that when the wetlands is wet, the plant will</p>
        <p>grow faster. I learned that you can cover a wetland by putting dirt over it or</p> 
        <p>draining the water out from it! Some people use bog wetlands to grow fruit.</p> 

        <p>When I was reading “ Wetlands and Nature”, I learned that wetlands</p> 
        <p>provide the great amounts of food that attracts many animals to come.</p>  
        <p>Many animals use wetlands in parts of their life-cycle.</p>  

        <p>Then, I read“Natural Products for Our Economy”, I learned that wetlands</p> 
        <p>also produce blueberries, cranberries, fish, shellfish, timber, and wild rice.</p> 
        <p>Many medicines come from the wetlands soil and plants.  This will help me</p> 
        <p>in the experiment because it will teach me and others that wetlands are not</p> 
        <p>only good for animals and plants.  They are also good for humans since</p> 
        <p>people eat fruits.</p>

        <p>In “ Fish and Wildlife Habitat”, I learned that many people in the United</p> 
        <p>States endangered species that lived in wetlands.  When people cover</p> 
        <p>wetlands to make new cities, they are actually harming many animals.  This</p> 
        <p>is an important fact because we need to start protecting the animals that</p> 
        <p>live in wetlands instead of endangering them.</p> 

        <p>I will be able to do a better experiment because of all the amazing facts I</p> 
        <p>have learned throughout my research!  One thing I will do is to use a ruler</p> 
        <p>to measure the lengths of the plants.  I have not changed my experiment</p> 
        <p>because I can prove whether plants grow better in wetlands that are</p> 
        <p>soaked, wet or dry.</p>
